  abstract   = {A method is described which models the interaction of light between diffusely reflecting surfaces. Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the “color-bleeding” effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

  abstract   = {We facilitate the creation of 3D-looking shaded production drawings from concept sketches. The key to our approach is a class of commonly used construction curves known as cross-sections, that function as an aid to both sketch creation and viewer understanding of the depicted 3D shape. In particular, intersections of these curves, or cross-hairs, convey valuable 3D information, that viewers compose into a mental model of the overall sketch. We use the artist-drawn cross-sections to automatically infer the 3D normals across the sketch, enabling 3D-like rendering.The technical contribution of our work is twofold. First, we distill artistic guidelines for drawing cross-sections and insights from perception literature to introduce an explicit mathematical formulation of the relationships between cross-section curves and the geometry they aim to convey. We then use these relationships to develop an algorithm for estimating a normal field from cross-section curve networks and other curves present in concept sketches. We validate our formulation and algorithm through a user study and a ground truth normal comparison. As demonstrated by the examples throughout the paper, these contributions enable us to shade a wide range of concept sketches with a variety of rendering styles.},

  abstract    = {Colorization and illumination are key processes for creating animated cartoons. Computer assisted methods have been incorporated in animation/illustration systems to reduce the artists' effort. This paper presents a new strategy for illumination and colorization of 2D drawings based on a region-tree. Starting from a hand-drawn cartoon, it extracts geometric and topological information and builds a tree structure, ensuring independence among parts of the drawing, such as curves and regions. Based on this structure and its attributes, a colorization method that propagates through consecutive frames of animation is proposed, together with an interpolation method that accurately computes a normal mapping for the illumination process. Different operators on curve and region attributes can be applied independently, obtaining different rendering effects.},

  year     = {2013},
  abstract = {Pixel art is a popular artistic style adopted in the gaming industry, and nowadays, it is often accompanied by modern rendering techniques. One example is dynamic lighting for the game sprites, for which normal mapping defines how the light interacts with the material represented by each pixel. Although there are different methods to generate normal maps for 3D games, applying them for pixel art may not yield correct results due to the style specificities. Therefore, this work compiles different normal map generation methods and study their applicability for pixel art, reducing the scarcity of existing material on the techniques and contributing to a qualitative analysis of the behavior of these methods in different case studies.},

  pages    = {52},
  abstract = {This paper presents a novel technique to model a three dimensional freeform surface, in its global shape and small details, using a sketching interface, from a single point of view. In the past, most modeling systems that used sketches as input reconstructed the shape from the silhouette, and the user had few control on the inner parts of the result. In our system, we generate a grid of co-planar lines from a small number of strokes that the user drew, then we estimate the normal vector where it is constrained, and we form the surface by propagating this information to the whole grid. As a result, smaller strokes act locally to add detail, while longer strokes modify the whole surface. Our system gives a new approach to the modeling from sketches problem, and is intended to be a part of a more complex modeling system.},

Image segmentation is a classic subject in the field of image processing and also is a hotspot and focus of image processing techniques. Several general-purpose algorithms and techniques have been developed for image segmentation. Since there is no general solution to the image segmentation problem, these techniques often have to be combined with domain knowledge in order to effectively solve an image segmentation problem for a problem domain.

Os recentes avanços tecnológicos têm proporcionado o desenvolvimento de novos satélites, os quais são capazes de realizar medidas mais precisas e, juntamente com o aumento na quantidade de satélites em órbita a disponibilidade das imagens de sensoriamento remoto tem aumentado. Estes fatos, por sua vez, têm motivado o desenvolvimento de novos métodos para o processamento e extração de informações sobre tais imagens. Dentre esses métodos destaca-se a segmentação de imagem. Conceitualmente, a segmentação de imagem é fundamentada em características da fotointerpretação humana, que permitem a distinção entre diferentes alvos distribuídos ao longo de uma imagem. Neste contexto, este trabalho apresenta um novo método de segmentação de imagens que integra conceitos de segmentação baseados em detecção de bordas e regiões. Uma análise comparativa entre os métodos proposto e o método Crescimento de Regiões é conduzida sobre dois estudos de caso que envolvem dados reais e simulados. Os resultados obtidos mostram que o método proposto neste estudo apresenta melhores índices de ajuste quando é permitida a segmentação de alvos com pequenas dimensões.},

ABSTRACT = {Image segmentation, which has become a research hotspot in the field of image processing and computer vision, refers to the process of dividing an image into meaningful and non-overlapping regions, and it is an essential step in natural scene understanding. Despite decades of effort and many achievements, there are still challenges in feature extraction and model design. In this paper, we review the advancement in image segmentation methods systematically. According to the segmentation principles and image data characteristics, three important stages of image segmentation are mainly reviewed, which are classic segmentation, collaborative segmentation, and semantic segmentation based on deep learning. We elaborate on the main algorithms and key techniques in each stage, compare, and summarize the advantages and defects of different segmentation models, and discuss their applicability. Finally, we analyze the main challenges and development trends of image segmentation techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new general type-2 fuzzy logic method for edge detection applied to color format images. The proposed algorithm combines the methodology based on the image gradients and general type-2 fuzzy logic theory to provide a powerful edge detection method. General type-2 fuzzy inference systems are approximated using the α-planes approach. The edge detection method is tested on a database of color images with the idea of illustrating the advantage of applying the fuzzy edge detection approach on color images against grayscale format images, and also when the images are corrupted by noise. This paper compares the proposed method based on general type-2 fuzzy logic with other edge detection algorithms, such as ones based on type-1 and interval type-2 fuzzy systems. Simulation results show that edge detection based on a general type-2 fuzzy system outperforms the other methods because of its ability to handle the intrinsic uncertainty in this problem.},

abstract = {Abstract Multimodal learning provides a path to fully utilize all types of information related to the modeling target to provide the model with a global vision. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a general solution for incorporating prior knowledge into data-driven models and achieving accurate class identification. The combination of the two, known as multimodal ZSL (MZSL), can fully exploit the advantages of both technologies and is expected to produce models with greater generalization ability. However, the MZSL algorithms and applications have not yet been thoroughly investigated and summarized. This study fills this gap by providing an objective overview of MZSL's definition, typical algorithms, representative applications, and critical issues. This article will not only provide researchers in this field with a comprehensive perspective, but it will also highlight several promising research directions.
