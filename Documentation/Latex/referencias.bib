	abstract = {A method is described which models the interaction of light between diffusely reflecting surfaces. Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the “color-bleeding” effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

	abstract = {We facilitate the creation of 3D-looking shaded production drawings from concept sketches. The key to our approach is a class of commonly used construction curves known as cross-sections, that function as an aid to both sketch creation and viewer understanding of the depicted 3D shape. In particular, intersections of these curves, or cross-hairs, convey valuable 3D information, that viewers compose into a mental model of the overall sketch. We use the artist-drawn cross-sections to automatically infer the 3D normals across the sketch, enabling 3D-like rendering.The technical contribution of our work is twofold. First, we distill artistic guidelines for drawing cross-sections and insights from perception literature to introduce an explicit mathematical formulation of the relationships between cross-section curves and the geometry they aim to convey. We then use these relationships to develop an algorithm for estimating a normal field from cross-section curve networks and other curves present in concept sketches. We validate our formulation and algorithm through a user study and a ground truth normal comparison. As demonstrated by the examples throughout the paper, these contributions enable us to shade a wide range of concept sketches with a variety of rendering styles.},

@misc{Nascimento,
	abstract = {Colorization and illumination are key processes for creating animated cartoons. Computer assisted methods have been incorporated in animation/illustration systems to reduce the artists' effort. This paper presents a new strategy for illumination and colorization of 2D drawings based on a region-tree. Starting from a hand-drawn cartoon, it extracts geometric and topological information and builds a tree structure, ensuring independence among parts of the drawing, such as curves and regions. Based on this structure and its attributes, a colorization method that propagates through consecutive frames of animation is proposed, together with an interpolation method that accurately computes a normal mapping for the illumination process. Different operators on curve and region attributes can be applied independently, obtaining different rendering effects.},

	abstract = {Pixel art is a popular artistic style adopted in the gaming industry, and nowadays, it is often accompanied by modern rendering techniques. One example is dynamic lighting for the game sprites, for which normal mapping defines how the light interacts with the material represented by each pixel. Although there are different methods to generate normal maps for 3D games, applying them for pixel art may not yield correct results due to the style specificities. Therefore, this work compiles different normal map generation methods and study their applicability for pixel art, reducing the scarcity of existing material on the techniques and contributing to a qualitative analysis of the behavior of these methods in different case studies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel technique to model a three dimensional freeform surface, in its global shape and small details, using a sketching interface, from a single point of view. In the past, most modeling systems that used sketches as input reconstructed the shape from the silhouette, and the user had few control on the inner parts of the result. In our system, we generate a grid of co-planar lines from a small number of strokes that the user drew, then we estimate the normal vector where it is constrained, and we form the surface by propagating this information to the whole grid. As a result, smaller strokes act locally to add detail, while longer strokes modify the whole surface. Our system gives a new approach to the modeling from sketches problem, and is intended to be a part of a more complex modeling system.},
